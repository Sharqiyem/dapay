sample workflow file that you can use as a starting point:

1. Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/main.yml`

2. Add the following content to the file:

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          path: build/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' # Only deploy on push to main branch

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          path: build/

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```

This workflow does the following:

1. Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch and on pull requests to the `main` branch.
2. Runs a `test` job that:
   - Checks out the code
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs tests
3. Runs a `build` job that:
   - Checks out the code
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the project
   - Uploads the build artifacts
4. Runs a `deploy` job that:
   - Only runs on pushes to the `main` branch
   - Downloads the build artifacts
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

You'll need to adjust this workflow based on your specific needs:

1. If you're not using GitHub Pages for deployment, replace the deployment step with your preferred deployment method.
2. Adjust the Node.js version if you're using a different version.
3. If you have environment variables or secrets, add them to your GitHub repository secrets and reference them in the workflow.
4. If you need to run additional commands (like linting), add them to the appropriate job.

For your smart contract:

1. Add a job to compile and test your smart contracts:

```yaml
smart-contract:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Compile smart contracts
      run: npx hardhat compile

    - name: Test smart contracts
```
